# ChatGPT Enhancement Suite

A powerful Chrome Extension that supercharges your ChatGPT experience with Auto-rename, Hierarchical Folders, a Prompt Toolbox, and a Quick Learn Window.

> **Note**: This project is based on the open-source [ChatGPT Conversation Timeline](https://github.com/example/repo) extension. We have stripped it down to focus on these core productivity features and added significant new functionality.
